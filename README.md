# ExploratoryDataAnalysis

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". There are 4 .R script files and 4 PNG files that are the results of these script files.  

To run these scripts, you should proceed with the following steps:
* Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some the ../data directory;
* Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
* Extract the data into the same directory;
* Run the scripts
